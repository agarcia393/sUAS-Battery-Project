# sUAS-Battery-Project
Battery life is one of the most important aspects of an
small unnamed aerial system (sUAS) to complete any missions
effectively. The total flight time can often be heavily affected
by the given payload and current weather conditions during
any flight mission. Currently, there is no way for pilots to
have a reliable flight time estimate despite having only their
own experience to rely-on any given field conditions and flight
mission parameters. A matrix that would aims to provide an
estimated flight time by taking mission-specific data from the
field and computer simulation would close the guess work
involved and allow more freedom to the sUAS pilots.
